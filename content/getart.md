# I offer both graphite art and transit maps as commissions.

##### For graphite art, you can specify the following:

- which object should be drawn?
- which object should be drawn?
- which size of paper (standard: A4)
- any special details, what should be implemented? ♥

##### Alongside with a high quality scan, the drawing itself can be sent via post worldwide free of charge.


#### For transit maps, you can specify the following:

- which system should be portrayed? (city, country... etc.)
- which style do you choose? (Vaporwave / Retro / Dark / Pixel / Neon)
- which adjustments should be made? (color? anything specific you'd like to be implemented?)

##### Alongside with a 4K .png + .ai file, the print itself (cropped A3) can be sent via post worldwide free of charge.


##### Feel free to specify all of this in my → [contact form.](/contact) ←
