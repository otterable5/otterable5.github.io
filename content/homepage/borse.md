## Concessions:
At the Stock exchange, concessions can be purchased.

There are four types of concessions - 
- Coal mine
- Windmill
- Docks
- Sawmill.

Concessions are sets of 4 tickets. With each purchase, players can choose any combination of two tickets. Each tickets only exists once.

`Example: Player buys a Windmill concession for 2 Locomotives,  chooses 2 tickets - Favoriten and Baden. He can choose to buy the remaining two with the second purchase of the Windmill concession, or leave them up for sale for another player.`

## Trading:
The BÃ¶rse allows for players to buy and sell any track pieces. 

- Players can buy or sell tracks during their turn, the action itself doesn't cost a turn.
- Players can set ANY price. The price can be wagons (of any color he wishes), locomotives, coal, physical train pieces.
- Filled forms are stacked and any player can look into what's on sale at any time.

`Example: Player 1 wants to sell a piece of track between Pellendorf and Rannersdorf since he realised he doesn't need it anymore. He sets the price at 2 train pieces, since he needs them to build a different track. Player 2 looks in the stack of forms, finds the form with the track he needs, and decides to buy it during his turn, thus making an exchange with Player 1.`
