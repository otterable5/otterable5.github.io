### Overview:

Trams are unlocked by transporting 20 coal pieces `(combined total from all players, e.g. 4+7+9 = Trams can be unlocked)` to any of three power plants in Wien.

The Lower Austria tickets reward players with coal for finishing the ticket.

An explanation of the coal system as well with examples is below.


- Side note - The power plants are NOT easy to reach. Trams can be a serious game changer, therefore we intended them to be unlocked in the late game.
